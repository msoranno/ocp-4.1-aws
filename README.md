# OCP 4.1 on AWS (Official Documentation)

https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/welcome/index.html


## OpenShift Container Platform architecture

### CUSTOM OPERATING SYSTEM

- OpenShift Container Platform uses Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS), a new container-oriented operating system that combines some of the best features and functions of the CoreOS and Red Hat Atomic Host operating systems.

- RHCOS is specifically designed for running containerized applications from OpenShift Container Platform and works with new tools to provide fast installation, Operator-based management, and simplified upgrades.

- RHCOS includes:
	
	- Ignition, which is a firstboot system configuration for initially bringing up and configuring OpenShift Container Platform nodes.

	- cri-o, a Kubernetes native container runtime implementation that integrates closely with the operating system to deliver an efficient and optimized Kubernetes experience.

	- Kubelet, the primary node agent for Kubernetes that is responsible for launching and monitoring containers.


> In OpenShift Container Platform 4.1, you must use RHCOS for all control plane machines, but you can use Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) as the operating system for compute, or worker, machines. **If you choose to use RHEL workers, you must perform more system maintenance than if you use RHCOS for all of the cluster machines.**

### SIMPLIFIED INSTALLATION AND UPDATE PROCESS

For clusters that use RHCOS for all machines, updating, or upgrading, OpenShift Container Platform is a simple, highly-automated process. Because OpenShift Container Platform completely controls the systems and services that run on each machine, including the operating system itself, from a central control plane, upgrades are designed to become automatic events. **If your cluster contains RHEL worker machines, the control plane benefits from the streamlined update process, but you must perform more tasks to upgrade the RHEL machines.**

### OTHER KEY FEATURES

- Operators

- OLM (operator lifecycle manager)

- CRIO-O. Container Engine

- Quay. Red hat container registry


## Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS)

- RHCOS is the only supported operating system for OpenShift Container Platform control plane, or master, machines. While RHCOS is the default operating system for all cluster machines, you can create compute, or worker, machines that use RHEL as their operating system.

- Management is performed remotely from the OpenShift Container Platform cluster. When you set up your RHCOS machines, you can modify only a few system settings

- Although RHCOS contains features for running the OCI- and libcontainer-formatted containers that Docker requires, it incorporates the CRI-O container engine instead of the Docker container engine

- At the moment, CRI-O is only available as a container engine within OpenShift Container Platform clusters.

- For tasks such as building, copying, and otherwise managing containers, RHCOS replaces the Docker CLI tool with a compatible set of container tools. While direct use of these tools in RHCOS is discouraged, you can use them for debugging purposes.

- RHCOS features transactional upgrades and rollbacks using the rpm -ostree upgrade system.

- Ignition is the utility that is used by RHCOS to manipulate disks during initial configuration. It completes common disk tasks, including partitioning disks, formatting partitions, writing files, and configuring users. On first boot, Ignition reads its configuration from the installation media or the location that you specify and applies the configuration to the machines.

## Install

### Register a new domain on aws 

We are going to register the iaciscp.net

- On aws go to Route 53
- Register a new domain
- Fulfil all the information required.
- Accept received email confirmation
- wait for the domain to be available (15 mins)
- **Disable the automatic renovation**

> This process will automatically create a aws hosted zone

```
[sp81891@oc2157818656 ~]$ dig iaciscp.net

### AWS account limits

> To avoid reaching the DEFAULT resources limit (per account) on eu-central-1 (Frankfurt) we are going to work on eu-west-2 (London).

- AZ's available on eu-west-2 region

```
[sp81891@oc2157818656 ~]$ aws ec2 describe-availability-zones --region eu-west-2
{
    "AvailabilityZones": [
        {
            "State": "available",
            "Messages": [],
            "RegionName": "eu-west-2",
            "ZoneName": "eu-west-2a",
            "ZoneId": "euw2-az2"
        },
        {
            "State": "available",
            "Messages": [],
            "RegionName": "eu-west-2",
            "ZoneName": "eu-west-2b",
            "ZoneId": "euw2-az3"
        },
        {
            "State": "available",
            "Messages": [],
            "RegionName": "eu-west-2",
            "ZoneName": "eu-west-2c",
            "ZoneId": "euw2-az1"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Resources to be deployed

- 1 VPC

- 2 NAT gateways

- 3 EIPs. One for every Nat Gateway attached to every private subnet in every Az.

- 1 External NLB

- 1 Internal NLB

- 1 ELB

- 27 ENIs for every AZ.

- 1 VPC Gateway for S3 access.

- 2 S3 buckets

- 10 Security Groups


### Required AWS permissions

When you attach the AdministratorAccess policy to the IAM user that you create, you grant that user all of the required permissions

### Installing a cluster on AWS with customizations

https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-customizations.html#installing-aws-customizations

In OpenShift Container Platform version 4.1, you can install a customized cluster on infrastructure that the installation program provisions on Amazon Web Services (AWS). To customize the installation, you modify some parameters in the install-config.yaml file before you install the cluster.

#### Obtaining the installation program

- go to https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/aws/installer-provisioned

- Then download installer & Copy the pull secret 

	https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/latest/openshift-install-linux-4.1.4.tar.gz

	```
	tar xvf openshift-install-linux-4.1.4.tar.gz

	sudo mv openshift-install /usr/local/bin

	[sp81891@oc2157818656 ~]$ openshift-install version
	openshift-install v4.1.4-201906271212-dirty
	built from commit bf47826c077d16798c556b1bd143a5bbfac14271
	release image quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release@sha256:a6c177eb007d20bb00bfd8f829e99bd40137167480112bd5ae1c25e40a4a163a

	```


#### Generating an SSH private key and adding it to the agent

> You can use this key to SSH into the master nodes as the user **core**. When you deploy the cluster, the key is added to the core userâ€™s ~/.ssh/authorized_keys list.


- If you do not have an SSH key that is configured for password-less authentication on your computer, create one.

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -N '' -f <path>/<file_name>

```

- Start the ssh-agent process as a background task

```
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

- Add the ssh private key to the ssh-agent

```
# add 
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# list

ssh-add -l

2048 SHA256:GJnFpJMvKyXvCAVWy3TvJQJJdI5RE9BCoIuUAIoPiso /home/sp81891/.ssh/id_rsa (RSA)

```

#### Creating the installation configuration file

- This process will use the [default] section on your aws credentials file.

- If you don't have a [default] section or the credential file, the installer will ask you access and secret key.

- At the end, the installer will create a [default] section on the aws credential file. **(careful)**

```
openshift-install create install-config --dir=install_files
